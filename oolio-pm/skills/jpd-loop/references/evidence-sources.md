# jpd-loop — evidence sources & connectors (reference)

Read this when gathering evidence to validate an idea (loop step 3). The job: find evidence **for and against** the idea, from internal and external sources, and turn the strongest items into cited Insights (see `insights-and-citations.md`).

## Required connectors (and what each is for)
The loop should have these connected; if one is missing, note the gap and continue with what's available.

| Connector | Use it to find |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Atlassian** (Jira + Confluence) | Related ideas across the whole JPD backlog; existing PRDs, specs, research notes; decision records; the VPC concept and personas. |
| **Web search + web browsing** | Competitor features and pricing, market trends, analyst/industry sources, public reviews, standards/regulation. Use `WebSearch` to find, then `web_fetch` (or the Chrome browser tools for JS-heavy pages) to read. |
| **HubSpot** | CRM evidence — deal blockers, churn/retention signals, customer requests tied to the idea, pipeline impact. |
| **Slack** | Internal discussion — has this been raised, decided, or rejected before? Customer/sales/support threads about the problem. |
| **Microsoft 365 / Teams** | Teams chat, Outlook threads, and SharePoint documents — strategy decks, research, board/QBR material, customer correspondence. |
| **Figma** | Existing designs, flows, or prototypes the idea touches or duplicates. |

## Internal wikis (our own knowledge)
- **Oolio Brain** wiki vault — query via the `oolio-brain:wiki-query` skill ("what does the brain say about …") for our own product/competitor/market knowledge before going external.
- **Confluence** spaces — PM (concept, strategy), DISC (discovery), product-area spaces.

> Notes: prefer AU region pages where they exist (Square `/help/au/en`). Several KBs are login-gated (H&L, SevenRooms, ResDiary) or in-app (MarketMan, Zeller) — use public site/feature/pricing pages in those cases. Not found with a public KB: Craftable, Como, Menulog partner, Nory — revisit. Add more as we go.

## Social signal (optional, deeper)
Neither this loop nor the connectors above cover social media, review sites, or scaled web scraping. For a decision where that signal matters (a contested Park/Kill, thin internal evidence), run `signal-radar` on the idea first and fold its Insight list into step 3 — it covers HubSpot theme aggregation and social/Apify sources this file doesn't, and syncs findings to Oolio Brain so future loops start ahead.

## How to search well
- Start internal (Oolio Brain, Confluence, Slack, HubSpot) — cheaper and more specific — then go external (web) for market/competitor context.
- Look for **disconfirming** evidence too, not just support. The council's value is the clash.
- Capture the **source URL** for every claim — uncited claims don't become Insights.
- Prefer primary sources (a competitor's own page, a real customer thread, an analytics figure) over second-hand summaries.
